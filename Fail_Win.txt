Confucius once said: "You sometimes win, and you often fail." I agree with this because Murphy's law says "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." Therefore when something goes right for you, you should celebrate!
I tend to celebrate by eating food. Lots and lots of food. Food is the best. When you win at things, you should eat celbreat (celebrate/ate)
Even when things go wrong, I eat lots and lots of food. Food makes me feel better! There is nothing better than ice cream.
Unless you count brownies with ice cream. When I'm tired, I often find that brownies with ice cream motivate me to keep working. However, the brownies sometimes freeze
and I have trouble eating them. Chocolate ice cream with brownies is quite awful. There's too much chocolate in these desserts
and I can't distinguish flavors as easily.

We learn a lot from failure, true.
But it hurts a lot, kangaro kick ado.
In the end, we pick ourselves up and keep going, coo?

All failures are actually successes in disguise, only that this truth may not be immediately apparent.
You just have to believe me. If you lose, but you learn, then you have actually won.
This will increase your chances of success in the future, as every piece of knowledge that you acquire will come in handy and be applicable at some point.
