Veggie Bacon,
oh veggie bacon
I weep for thee.
Why don't you taste like real bacon?
Why do you look like bacon
But are not bacon?
Forsooth, that thou hast forsaken me,
my veggie bacon.
For now my stomach revolts,
and roughage pervades.
The pigs' revenge is upon us.

But do we think of how the plant feels?
Now fatty and nasty, yet once green and teal.
And while we save an oinker, these fiberous ones become the meal.
