There was a pricetag named Tag. Tag had a quite boring life of pricing
a sweater. One day, however, he fell off of the sweater and was blown
away by a gust of air-conditioning. He was sent spiriling out into the
unknown wilderness, unsure where he would end up.

what's in a tag? what's in a tag? nothing I can see. Aside from a damp one lost out at sea. He came from a faraway land named Smee. But first of all he came from a tree.
