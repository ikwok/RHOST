Cows were not always green, or so my grandfather says. I find this a little hard to believe, as he also has a habit of exaggerating the past in an attempt to impress me, but let's just suppose we take his statement to be true. Cows were not always green, but they are now green, and my grandfather doesn't really have an explanation for how that came about--after all, we only have seventy years between us.
