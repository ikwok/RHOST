There was an issue with the candle. It had a really bad smell. The monkey solved the issue by throwing the candle away. 
But the next day, the smell was back! Where was it coming from? The monkey just had to find out.

The monkey put on his detective hat and pulled out his detective magnifying glass and began the search. If he had alreadly thrown the candle away... where could it be coming from?

The monkey began his search in the basement.

He looked through every room in his house. When he finally got to his bedroom, he found the candle back on his desk. But he was sure he had thrown it away!

The monkey scratched his head in confusion. He picked the candle up and walked out to the dumpster. "This time I'm definitely throwing you out," he said to the candle. 
 

As the monkey tossed the candle into the dumpster, suddenly a seagull swooped by and snatched it out of the air! The seagull circled around overhead, until finally flying through the window in the monkeys house. The monkey ran inside to chase the seagull out, but when He went into his room, all that was there was the candle, as if it had never been moved.The monkey scratched his head in confusion. He picked the candle up and walked out to the dumpster. "This time I'm definitely throwing you out," he said to the candle.

And then the candle replied. The monkey did not expect the candle to reply. Then again, the candle did not expect a talking monkey to be handling it so roughly.

The candle asked, "Why are you throwing me away?"

The monkey said, "Because you stink." 

The candle replied, annoyed, "It is not I who stink; it is the candle holder, you baboon!"

At this point, the monkey's annoyance got the better of him and he threw the candle and its smelly holder through the window. Unfortunately, the screen was down. And with a brief bounce, the candle was back.
